The most common waiting periods are 4, 13, 26 weeks and a year. The longer you wait, the lower the monthly premiums.<p>It’s not the same as critical illness insurance, which pays out a one-off lump sum if you have a specific serious illness.<h2>How does income protection insurance work?</h2><p>When we're unable to work due to illness or an accident, you might assume that your employer will continue to give you some level of income.<p>In reality, however, employees are usually moved onto Statutory Sick Pay within six months. Very few employers support their staff for more than a year if they’re off sick from work.<p>Depending on the level of savings you have, the loss of an income can soon leave you unable to pay essential household bills, such as mortgage/rent and utilities.<p>It can be particularly difficult if you’re self-employed and so have no sick pay to fall back on.<h2>How do I buy income protection insurance?</h2><p>Premiums can vary and different insurers can use very different criteria. So it’s worth shopping around and doing a bit of research.<p>The best way to make sure you get what you need is to get advice from an independent financial advisor or specialist broker. They can take you through the details of the various policies available and make sure you choose the right one.<p>There are also specialist brokers and insurers for people who have been declined insurance. This might be perhaps because of a medical condition or because they do a job that isn’t covered by standard policies."
